    "description": "My job mission is to deliver a quality solution to various natural-language and automation tasks that requires artificial intelligence and machine learning approach, esp. with big data at hand. I had succesful experience creating corpus out of many gigabytes of text data for information extraction. I also had experience managing website with over 1000 views per minute and ranked 8000 global rank on Alexa.\n\nI am able to implement algorithms from academic papers. My PhD paper has been published in Q1 journal and I had worked with top academic researcher such as MIT. I am expert in using Topic Model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, able to extend it and able to use word embedding such as Word2Vec and Glove to augment classification performance.\n\nIf you&#039;re looking for deep-learning solution, look no further.  I use neural models such as Pytorch, Tensorflow and Transformer models such as LSTM-CRF, BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3. These will be a great arsenal for classification, sequence labeling, extraction, natural language generation or other relevant tasks for your problem domain. ",
